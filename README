==== NAME ====

LCFG::Build::PkgSpec - Object-oriented interface to LCFG build metadata

==== DESCRIPTION ====

This class provides an object-oriented interface to the LCFG build
tools metadata file. All simple fields are available through attribute
accessors. Specific methods are also provided for querying and
modifying the more complex data types (e.g. lists and hashes).

This class has methods for carrying out specific procedures related to
tagging releases with the LCFG build tools. It also has methods for
handling the old format LCFG build configuration files.

More information on the LCFG build tools is available from the website
http://www.lcfg.org/doc/buildtools/


==== DEPENDENCIES ====

This module needs perl 5.8.1 or newer (that's for Moose nothing in
this code needs it).

To build this module you will need the following:

        Module::Build

To use this module you will need the following:

        DateTime
        Data::Structure::Util >= 0.12
        Moose >= 0.57
        MooseX::AttributeHelpers >= 0.13
        YAML::Syck >= 0.98

==== INSTALLATION ====

Make sure you have the dependencies installed first! (see DEPENDENCIES above)

If you don't know how to install these, try using the CPAN module, an easy
way of auto-installing modules from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network,
where the above modules reside. Do "perldoc perlmodinstall" or "perldoc
CPAN" for more information.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the "./"
notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

In order to install somewhere other than the default, such as in a directory
under your home directory, like "/home/fred/perl" go

   perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl

as the first step instead.

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will also need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable
to find the modules, and the PATH variable to find the script.

Therefore you will need to change: your path, to include
/home/fred/perl/script (where the script will be)

        export PATH=/home/fred/perl/script:${PATH}

the PERL5LIB variable to add /home/fred/perl/lib

        export PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}

If you want to install in a temporary install directory (such as if you are
building a package) then instead of going

   perl Build install

go

   perl Build install destdir=/my/temp/dir

and it will be installed there, with a directory structure under
/my/temp/dir the same as it would be if it were installed plain. Note that
this is NOT the same as setting --install_base, because certain things are
done at build-time which use the install_base info.

See "perldoc perlrun" for more information on PERL5LIB, and see "perldoc
Module::Build" for more information on installation options.
